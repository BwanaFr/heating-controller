# Heating controller

## Presentation

These heaters where mainly installed in France.
The principle is to store heat in the concrete floor during nights (when nuclear plants are free) to be restored during the day.

The heater can be controlled using MQTT using a Wi-Fi connection or using the integrated OLED display.
It is designed to be mounted on a DIN rail in an electrical cabinet.

## Hardware
Hardware design files are located in the hardware folder.
Schematics and PCB is designed using Kicad.

# Software
Microcontroller firmware is located in the software folder.
This is a PlatformIO project.
